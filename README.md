# GraphPathFinder
This is a small project that uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the fastest path to the end of a graph.

You can use this bit of code to find the fastest path to a point on a graph given a certain start and end.

The program comes loaded with an automatically generated graph for showcase purposes, but feel free to modify it for your need or even just manually add a graph. I would however encourage you to create a callable object as that is how I personally had the easiest time using.

Good Programming!!!
